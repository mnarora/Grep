I am trying to implement grep command in linux operating system
Following are the options in my project
-c : It prints no. of lines that will match given pattern
-h : It displays the matched lines, but do not display filenames
-H : It displays the matched lines alongwith filenames
-n : It displays the matched lines alongwith line no.
-i : It ignores the case while matching
-l : It displays list of filenames only
-w : It matches the whole word from the file
-o : Print only the matched parts of a matching line
-E : It treats pattern as extended regular expression
-v : It prints all the lines that do not match pattern
-e exp : It specifies expression and can be used multiple times.
-f file : It takes patterns from file, one per line.
